Does your calendar reflect your day? For many of us, it does not. We do stuff all the time that we don't see reflected in our calendar. Somebody calls and you drop everything. Or, you are not in the mood. Whatever the reason, it actually makes more sense to create the day 'on the go', rather than follow a plan.

This is how many creative people, like myself, work. As the tasks at hand are unpredictable, I don't manage time as much as I manage deliverables. I try to keep my deadlines and usually succeed. But, that comes with a price.

**The problem with unplanned tasks is that we don't realize just how much time they consume.** Often, we wonder --- is there any room left for new tasks? What is our availability? My private life is my buffer. If I don't manage my commitments, I lose evenings, weekends and recreational time with friends and family --- and I hate that.

Any work or task at hand is a commitment --- you were asked to do something and you agreed. There are two types of commitments we make. One happens at a particular time, like a meeting or a haircut. The other happens when you feel like it or have time for it. We usually keep the latter in our to-do lists, as time planning each task takes too much effort and usually does not happen as planned.

Whenever you accept a new commitment, you ask yourself --- can I do it? Commitments that come with a time frame, such as a meeting, are easy to plan --- you just see whether you are available at that time and plan accordingly. But, everything else is piled up on your to-do list, until you have a nervous breakdown.

The Great Unplanned is killing us. The amount of tasks and commitments we have to carry in our heads is slowing us down. We might not feel it all the time, but just ask yourself --- when you've completed all of your tasks, how many of these were commitments?

Our team is on the verge of solving that problem. **[Hourdini][0], the magical planner we built, takes all of your unplanned commitments and makes them into a manageable flow. **We took the managerial level of design services, budget/project/time tracking/invoices and married that to the calendar with self-planning algorithms. We solved the issue of knowing how much work you have and what happens to your existing commitments, when you accept a new one. **The goal is for you to have none of those hardly moving projects that just take up your mental space. **You either have them in your flow or they don't exist at all.

You are welcome!
